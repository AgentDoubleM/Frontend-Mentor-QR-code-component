# Frontend-Mentor-QR-code-component

Hello there dear visitor! I see you wanted to take a look at my code! Well look as much as you want :)

But you will notice that I have no idea how to position the QR code properly. If you have any tips on how to do that I would greatly appreciate it.

Pls... send help!

Kind regards,
ADM
